- Note that box colliders are used.
- Colliders, scripts and tags attached to flamable objects are attached to cubes in the models.
- Objects have weird origin positions - rotating makes the rotation like on a large circle, fire starts somewhere else (far away from the actual object).
- Changed how the steam effect works. Not a coroutine anymore. Instantiated and it destroys itself after 1.2s (particle duration option)
- Ammunition for water gun works properly now.
- Cleaned the code.
